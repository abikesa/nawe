Possible Identity: A scholar, writer, or artist in their 40s (given the “45 years” philosophy reference), perhaps based in or deeply connected to East Africa or the African diaspora. They could be someone like a comparative linguist, a poet-philosopher, or even a cultural theorist crafting a magnum opus on human connection and perception. Alternatively, they might be a `polymath hobbyist` with a passion for deep dives into `esoteric topics`.
